# Mini Projects
This repository is a collection of small-scale projects that have been created primarily for educational purposes. Each project within this repository is designed to demonstrate various programming concepts and techniques, providing practical examples and real-world applications of these principles.
## Table of contents: 
* [Guess the Number Game](https://github.com/vanya-koleva/mini_projects/tree/main/guess_a_number)

The game challenges the player to guess a number that the computer has chosen within a certain time limit. The game increases in difficulty with each level, expanding the range of possible numbers. It is implemented in Python and uses libraries such as **random**, **time**, **unicodedata**, and **colorama** for generating random numbers, tracking time, displaying Unicode characters, and coloring terminal text, respectively. The game is themed around the Korean pop group BTS.
* [Rock, Paper, Scissors Game](https://github.com/vanya-koleva/mini_projects/tree/main/rock_paper_scissors)
  
The game allows the player to compete against the computer in a classic game of rock, paper, scissors. The player chooses their move, and the computer randomly selects its move. The game continues until the player decides to stop, and the final scores are then displayed. The project uses libraries such as **random**, **time**, **unicodedata**, and **colorama**. The game is themed around the Korean pop group BTS.
* [Card Number Validator](https://github.com/vanya-koleva/mini_projects/blob/main/card_number_validator.py)
  
This project takes a credit card number as input and checks whether it is valid or not based on the Luhn algorithm. The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, especially credit card numbers.
* [Expense Tracker](https://github.com/vanya-koleva/mini_projects/blob/main/expense_tracker.py)
  
This project is an interactive expense tracker. It allows the user to add expenses, list all expenses, show total expenses, and filter expenses by category. Each expense consists of an amount and a category. The user interacts with the program through a menu-driven interface.
* [Vigenere Cipher Encryptor/Decryptor](https://github.com/vanya-koleva/mini_projects/blob/main/vigenere_cipher.py)
  
An implementation of the Vigen√®re cipher, a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It offers functionality to both encrypt and decrypt messages.
* [Password Generator](https://github.com/vanya-koleva/mini_projects/blob/main/password_generator.py)

This Python script generates a secure password based on user-defined or default requirements. The script uses libraries such as **re**, **secrets**, and **string** for regular expression matching operations, generating cryptographically strong random characters, and string constants, respectively.

* [Basic Calculator](https://github.com/vanya-koleva/mini_projects/blob/main/basic_calculator/basic_calculator.py)

A simple calculator implemented with **tkinter**.
